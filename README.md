#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/E0kZlM4pIKw>
#### Description: 
This project is containing 2 parts: 

1.	Creating your own cryptocurrency

In order to create an own crypto currency “PWS coin”, I have chosen to use a an existing blockchain platform called “Ethereum”. Herefore I have used the “Remix Ethereum IDE” as a Development Environment and “Solidity” as programming language. This is commonly used for programming smart contracts. Among other things, I programmed the contract of the token in which the definition of the token is defined. In addition, a number of functions were developed for transferring the token from sender to receiver and an approval function that checks whether there is sufficient value on the balance.
The code can be found in the file named: “Token.sol”

2.	Programming a website from scratch

In order to program an own website from scratch I have used Visual Studio Code as IDE. The website consists of 4 pages, that are all linked with a hyperlink, so that you can go from each page to any other of the 4 pages. For the text on the pages, I used the HTML programming language and for the design of the pages I used CSS. For example, I added colours, changed fonts, added images, integrated a logo etc etc. 

The code can be found in the files named:

Home.html

Token.html

Website.html

CS50x.html

Styles.css

In a document called: PWS Crypto 2021[2980].docx you can find my scription that is telling more about the background story of crypto currency, the block chain fundamentals and how to create your own.
